EDITABLE TABLE
--------------

This project goal is to make an open source web based excel like based on YUI 3.

We use the current YUI 3 version : 3.4.1
We use twitter bootstrap for css version 1.4.0

- Directory structure :
-----------------------

    /css            -> place to put our custom css file
    /js             -> place to put our custom js file
    /js/main.js     -> the main js file
    /js/plugins     -> our YUI custom plugin
    /js/widgets     -> our YUI custom widget
    /js/modules     -> our YUI custom modules
    /images         -> place to put our images
    /scripts        -> place to put our script (php). Just to test the dynamic save/load data
    index.html      -> the base html file

- Conention :
-------------

    - Coding :
    ----------
        - 4 spaces indentation
        - for code (mainly js) : camelCase notation
        - for html/css : word are split with a - (ie: element-wrapper)
        - open bracket : if(test) {
        - else statement : } else {
    
        For vim, we can use this settings (placed in your .vimrc) :
            set cindent
            set tabstop=4
            set shiftwidth=4
            set expandtab

    - Scripts :
    -----------
        We use script just to receive data from the UI (to simulate a save for exemple) or send data back to the ui
        Data are always JSON. We might add a plugin later to handle other format.
